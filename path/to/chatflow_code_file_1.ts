Since we are modifying an existing file, there is no new file to create. The modifications will be made directly in the "path/to/chatflow_code_file_1.ts" file.

The modified code in "path/to/chatflow_code_file_1.ts" will be fully implemented and syntactically correct. All necessary functions, variables, and imports will be updated according to the changes in the GitHub Actions workflow.
